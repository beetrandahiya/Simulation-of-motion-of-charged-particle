# Simulation-of-motion-of-charged-particle
This is Simulation of motion of a charged particle inside a Uniform Electric field. It is probably the best use of matter.js I have ever done. Uniform Electric field apply a constant force. that can be calculated using the very simple formula F=qE . So, Enjoy the simulation , and follow me for more amazing stuff
